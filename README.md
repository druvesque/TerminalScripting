# TerminalScripting
rc files, scripts used for automation in windows cmd, powershell and bash

- The approach to this work started with idea of making my windows terminal closer to linux itself, so as to be faster at navigating the system and the work itself. 

- 1st step was setting up Vim in the system (add it to the path, easy-peasy), then I wanted to create an alias in the terminal:
    -Firstly, i did that using the doskey, but the problem with that was i need to do it everytime i open a new terminal, so it was a no-go. 
    -Then, I came across the concept of Batch Files
